# freeCodeCamp/Data Analysis with Python Projects/Demographic Data Analyzer

In this project I used pandas to make some statistics (ex. percentage of people who have a bachelor degree or percentage of people with higher education that earns over 50k) on an input .csv file containing a dataset extracted from from the 1994 Census database. For more details about the project I invite you to read them on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer).
